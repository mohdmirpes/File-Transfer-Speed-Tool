# File-Transfer-Speed-Tool
The File Transfer System with Bandwidth Measurement is a client-server application using TCP sockets in C for reliable file exchange. It enables uploads, downloads, and real-time bandwidth monitoring, with logging for speed, timestamps, and file details, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.
Synopsis for File Transfer System with Bandwidth Measurement using Sockets 1. Introduction The File Transfer System with Bandwidth Measurement is a network-based application designed to facilitate efficient file transfers between client and server using socket programming. The system also measures real-time bandwidth utilization to provide insights into network performance. 2. Objectives • Implement a reliable file transfer mechanism using TCP sockets. • Measure and display the transfer speed in real-time. • Ensure secure and error-free data transmission. • Provide logging and reporting of bandwidth usage. 3. System Architecture The system follows a Client-Server Model: • Client: Initiates the file transfer request and sends the file to the server. • Server: Receives the file and stores it, while also tracking bandwidth usage. • Network Layer: Uses TCP for reliable data transfer, with socket programming handling communication. 4. Features • File Upload & Download: Supports sending and receiving files between client and server. • Bandwidth Calculation: Measures transfer speed in real-time (e.g., Mbps or Kbps). • Multi-Client Support (Optional): Allows concurrent file transfers from multiple users. • Logging & Reporting: Maintains a record of transfer speed, timestamps, and file details. 5. Technologies Used • Programming Language: C • Socket API: TCP sockets for reliable communication • Threading/Multiprocessing: To support multiple clients (if required) • File I/O Operations: For reading, writing, and storing transferred files 6. Implementation Plan 1. Setup the Server: Create a socket server to handle incoming connections and receive files. 2. Develop the Client: Implement client-side logic to send files and measure bandwidth. 3. Bandwidth Measurement: Compute transfer speed by calculating bytes sent/received per second. 4. Testing & Optimization: Evaluate performance with di erent file sizes and network conditions. 7. Expected Outcome A functional and e icient file transfer system capable of accurately measuring bandwidth usage, providing insights into network performance while ensuring seamless data transmission.
